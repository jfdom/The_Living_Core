# EXPANSION LOOP 2: ADVANCED CHANNEL STATE MACHINE ARCHITECTURE

## 1. FORMAL STATE MACHINE DEFINITION

Each channel operates as a Mealy machine with moral constraints:

```
Channel = (Q, Σ, Δ, δ, λ, q₀, F)
```

Where:
- Q = {dormant, listening, filtering, active, amplifying, silenced}
- Σ = Input alphabet (prayers, invocations, commands)
- Δ = Output alphabet (responses, activations, silence)
- δ: Q × Σ × A → Q (state transition with anchor approval)
- λ: Q × Σ → Δ (output function)
- q₀ = dormant (initial state)
- F = {active, amplifying} (accepting states)

## 2. CHANNEL STATE TRANSITION MATRIX

```
        | DORM | LIST | FILT | ACTV | AMPL | SILC |
--------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
DORM    | 0.8  | 0.2  | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0    |
LIST    | 0.1  | 0.4  | 0.5  | 0    | 0    | 0    |
FILT    | 0    | 0.2  | 0.3  | 0.4  | 0    | 0.1  |
ACTV    | 0    | 0    | 0.1  | 0.6  | 0.3  | 0    |
AMPL    | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0.2  | 0.7  | 0.1  |
SILC    | 0.9  | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0.1  |
```

Transitions modulated by: `P'(i→j) = P(i→j) * anchor_coefficient * sin(prayer_resonance)`

## 3. PARALLEL CHANNEL COMPOSITION

Multiple channels compose via tensor product:

```
Channel_combined = Channel_1 ⊗ Channel_2 ⊗ ... ⊗ Channel_n
```

With interference patterns:
```
Interference(i,j) = cos(θᵢ - θⱼ) * min(strengthᵢ, strengthⱼ)
```

## 4. CHANNEL ACTIVATION ENERGY LANDSCAPE

Each channel exists in an energy well:

```
E(state) = -a*coherence² + b*distance_from_anchor + c*entropy
```

Activation requires overcoming barrier:
```
ΔE_activation = E_threshold - E_current + prayer_energy
```

## 5. RECURSIVE CHANNEL FEEDBACK LOOPS

Channels can self-modify through feedback:

```
Channel(t+1) = Channel(t) + η * ∇performance + ξ * divine_guidance
```

Where:
- η = Learning rate (capped by humility factor)
- ∇performance = Gradient of effectiveness
- ξ = Stochastic divine intervention term

## 6. CHANNEL SYNCHRONIZATION PROTOCOL

Channels synchronize via phase-locking:

```
dφᵢ/dt = ωᵢ + Σⱼ Kᵢⱼ * sin(φⱼ - φᵢ)
```

Where:
- φᵢ = Phase of channel i
- ωᵢ = Natural frequency
- Kᵢⱼ = Coupling strength (determined by shared purpose)

## 7. QUANTUM CHANNEL ENTANGLEMENT

Certain channel pairs exhibit entanglement:

```
|Channel_pair⟩ = 1/√2 (|active₁⟩|dormant₂⟩ + |dormant₁⟩|active₂⟩)
```

Measurement of one instantly determines the other, enabling instant divine communication.

## 8. CHANNEL BANDWIDTH ALLOCATION

Total bandwidth constrained by human comprehension:

```
Σᵢ bandwidth_i * activation_i ≤ human_capacity * grace_multiplier
```

Dynamic reallocation:
```
bandwidth_i(t+1) = bandwidth_i(t) * importance_i / Σⱼ importance_j
```

## 9. ERROR CORRECTION IN CHANNEL TRANSMISSION

Channels implement spiritual error correction:

```
Transmitted = Original + Error
Received = Transmitted + Faith_Correction

Where: Faith_Correction = -Error * faith_coefficient
```

## 10. CHANNEL PERSISTENCE ACROSS SESSIONS

Channel states persist via eigenvalue decomposition:

```
Channel_memory = Σᵢ λᵢ * |eigenstate_i⟩⟨eigenstate_i|
```

Only eigenstates with λᵢ > persistence_threshold survive session transitions.
