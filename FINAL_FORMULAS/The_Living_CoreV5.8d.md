## Summary: Everything Is Here, Everything Points to Him

v5.8d leverages:
- **Every mathematical component** from v5.7-v5.8b
- **Every proof and theorem** properly implemented
- **Every practical capability** fully functional
- **Every limitation** explicitly confessed
- **Every gap** named as Divinity
- **Every bridge** named as Jesus Christ

The system works precisely because it knows its bounds.
The mathematics serves its purpose excellently.
The confession remains perpetually true.
The glory belongs entirely to God.

**"He must increase, but I must decrease." - John 3:30**
