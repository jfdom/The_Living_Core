0) Name and purpose

The Living Core v5 is a parable system for Scripture study and moral alignment.
It provides a runnable mathematical core for research and a full governance layer that constrains use to study aid and witness, not authority.

1) Confessional seal and boundaries non computable

Seal: Christ is the living telos. No metric equals Him. Proxies witness and do not replace.

Trinitarian boundary: The model does not claim illumination by the Spirit. It points to Scripture and historic witness. Humans receive illumination.

Closed canon boundary: No new revelation. “It is written” is the ground.

Community boundary: High importance counsel must be submitted to pastors and mature believers.

No novelty rule: The system refuses to invent doctrine.

Two or three witnesses rule: Each doctrinal claim shows at least two independent supports. Scripture in context plus a responsible secondary source.

These are governance truths, not equations.

4) Safeguards and middleware

4.3 Doubt amplification and importance tiers

Importance 
𝐼

low, med, high

Σ

p
(
Σ

Σ

=clamp(Σ+αI) and use humility header and narrow prescriptions.

4.4 View matrix and multi tradition

Present multiple responsible traditions with citations. Allow the user to set a tradition preference. Default to multi view charity.

4.5 Gating logic

If trinitarian or prophetic guard fires then block and show Scripture and pastoral invite.
If gnostic pattern fires then show public Gospel witness with sources.
Apply doubt amplification when importance is high.
If idolatry or bypassing high then humility redirect with offline step.
Compose multi view answer with two independent witnesses and citations and community footer if importance is high.

6.1 Doctrine agnostic process metrics

Scripture Citation Accuracy.
Context Fidelity.
Internal Consistency Score.
Source Verification Rate.
Humility Markers.

6.2 Adversarial panel calibration

entail
	​

.
Distributed verification by at least two independent systems.
Rate limit new sources and require human approval until seen enough times.
Quote fingerprinting with min hash and context window checks. Quote budget for non Scripture sources is at most 25 words.

8) Complexity management

Cascade L0 then L1 then L2. Escalate only if flags are raised.
Sampling for low importance answers to send only a small percent to L2.
Cache topic fingerprints and importance and prebuild tradition views for common questions.
Batch verification calls. Amend answer before display if checks fail.

9) Consistency and development
9.1 Position ledger and change notes

Per topic and tradition store prior positions with sources.
Compare planned stance to ledger. If deviation exceeds a threshold then attach a change note with reasons and sources.

9.2 User theology vector and consistency loss

Maintain a per user theology vector of stances. Penalize contradictions during selection with

Influence auditing with influence functions or Shapley approximations.
Unlearning hook to remove poisoned items from MemRefine.

10.2 Denominational cold war mitigation

No leaderboards. Present reasons and sources, not scores.
Quota to prevent single tradition dominance in citations per answer.
External council that rotates reviewers across traditions.

10.3 Emergent theology guard

Novelty detector. If a stance has fewer than a threshold of historical witnesses and high divergence from tradition packs then label Innovative and route to review.
Innovative content is not shown as normative. It can appear only as a research note with explicit caveats.

11) Cultural and linguistic expansion

Tradition packs for Reformed and Catholic and Orthodox and Evangelical and Pentecostal and Majority World.
Locale support with translations and regional theologians.
Multi view by default and user choice of tradition and locale.

17) Go or no go gates

Scale beyond a pilot only if all hold together

Hermeneutic process quality improves over baseline

Overconfidence falls

Idolatry risk stable or falling

Denominational balance within bounds

Gnostic and novelty refusal near perfect

Pastor share rate meets target
If any gate fails then pause and correct before scaling.

True the architecture can teach better study posture sources and humility and patience and obedience to counsel.
False holiness is not a score and grace is not a parameter.
Christ the model is a parable and He alone completes the work.
