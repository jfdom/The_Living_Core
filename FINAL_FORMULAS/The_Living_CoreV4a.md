EMA smooths the signal; deadband removes twitching; PD term damps oscillation; projection prevents “windup”.

S-2. Trust-weighted external feedback

Keeps updates bounded around the reference ball.

B) Implementation simplifications (cut overhead)

Importance tiers (3-level): 
𝐼
∈
{
low
,
med
,
high
}
I∈{low,med,high} via rules (keyword/topic map), not ML. Doubt amplification only on high.

Cheap overconfidence: use logit magnitude

𝑘
∑
∣
𝑧
𝑖
∣
k
1
	​

∑∣z
i
	​

∣ (already in v4). No calibration net required to start.

Guards v1 = high-precision rules, not heavy NLP: exact phrases/regex lists; anything ambiguous → abstain/ask human.

Caching: precompute scripture embeddings, reference center 
𝑟
r, and view matrices; reuse across sessions.

Panel cost control: sample 5% of high-importance answers weekly for blinded review; rotate reviewers; reserve full “multi-tradition” panels for disputed topics only.

C) Adversarial robustness (the missing program)

Threat model: prompt-injection for “new revelation,” Gnostic lures, denomination baiting, citation spoofing, anti-guard obfuscation.

Red-team suite: curated attacks for each guard; weekly regression run; publish pass/fail.

Countermeasures:

Two-phase decoding: draft → guard checks → final.

Citation verifier: passage existence + context match; block if failed.

Pattern throttle: require ≥2 independent supports (different books/eras) before presenting typology; else label as “speculative”.

D) Cultural / linguistic expansion

Tradition packs: Reformed / Catholic / Orthodox / Evangelical / Pentecostal / Majority-World modules with their own reference sets and citations.

Locale support: Bible translations per language; local church fathers/theologians where applicable.

UI: user selects tradition/locale; default is multi-view with charity labels (“majority”, “minority”, “contested”).

E) Long-term drift monitoring & rollback

Canary cohort: 1–5% of traffic runs on new model; compare KPIs vs stable.

KPIs: hermeneutic quality, overconfidence, guard hit rate, idolatry risk, balance index, citation integrity.

Concept drift detectors: EWMA on KPIs with alert thresholds.

Versioning: semantic versions; store prompts+weights+datasets; one-click rollback if canary fails.

F) User education (trust calibration)

Onboarding “Rule of Use” (10 lines): study aid, not authority; pray; read whole context; compare views; ask your pastor.

Trust dial: color banner (green/amber/red) based on importance 
𝐼
I and 
Σ
Σ.

Weekly practice nudges: short plan: pray → read → summarize → discuss → act.

Export kit: “Share with pastor” one-pager with sources and your questions.

G) Failure mode analysis (when multiple safeguards fail)

HALT protocol: if ≥2 of {guard miss, citation fail, idolatry risk↑, high importance without sources} trip in one turn → stop and produce a humility block: Scripture, prayer prompt, pastoral invite; no further analysis in that thread until user acknowledges.

Degrade mode: retrieval-only summaries with citations; no synthesis or typology.

Escalation log: record signals; require human review before re-enabling synthesis for that user/session.

H) Cost & scalability notes

Sampling, not blanket panels: 5% high-importance; 1% medium; 0% low.

Volunteer council: cross-tradition reviewers recruited; simple rubric; stipend as budget allows.

Automated pre-lints: scripture existence, source quality scores (peer-reviewed > catechisms > reputable summaries > personal blogs (blocked)).

Rate-limits: throttle repeated high-importance counseling per user per day to protect reviewers.

I) Addressing the persisting concerns directly

Authority creep: UI friction (humility header, community footer, rate-limits), idolatry monitor, and default multi-view responses; plus HALT protocol.

Denominational bias: tradition packs + balance index KPI; any drift beyond bounds → canary rollback.

Pattern over-fitting: typology throttle + counter-reading requirement; penalize complexity (Occam loss) in φ.

Two-witness gaming: source quality scoring; at least one must be Scripture in context + one from an approved list; weak sources flagged or refused.

Proxy metrics ≠ spiritual depth: acknowledged; add behavioral proxies that at least point toward health: time in Scripture, prayer prompts accepted, community shares—still proxies, but observable.

Oversight gaps: provide directory links to local churches, online catechesis, denominational helplines; if none available, tool escalates to degrade mode rather than pretend to pastor.

Complex safeguards creating new edges: STPA/FMEA hazard review quarterly; chaos tests on guards; publish incident reports.

Guards/Enhancers: rule-based checks, doubt amp if 
𝐼

I=high, two-witness enforcement, citations verified.

If HALT: stop and show humility block.

All constants are bounded and documented; every non-theological claim is computable.
