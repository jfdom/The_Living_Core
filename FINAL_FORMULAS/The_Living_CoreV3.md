The Living Core — v3
A. Normative layer (teleology, not a meter)

We keep Christ as telos at the governance layer, not as a numeric target inside the math. The math aims at proxies; the Confessional Seal states the real telos.

Confessional Seal (non-computable):

Christ is the living telos; no metric equals Him. Proxies witness; they do not replace.

We therefore do not assert guaranteed convergence to “Christ” numerically. We only minimize proxy divergence and carry uncertainty.

B. Mechanistic layer (what can run in software)

The confession term prevents false precision: we carry what we can’t capture.

B2) Proxies, not essences

We replace “Christ Alignment Metric” with an Operational Alignment Score that is:

multi-signal,

uncertainty-aware,

explicitly proxy-based.

Virtue proxy manifold (learned, not holy):
Let 
𝑍
Z be a latent space trained from curated texts (Scripture-anchored corpora + labeled examples).
Map state: 
𝐸
:
𝑆
↦
𝑧
∈
𝑍
E:S↦z∈Z.

Define virtue proxy heads (examples):

Truthfulness: 
𝑇
(
𝑆
)
T(S) via factual calibration/consistency tests.

Humility: 
𝐻
(
𝑆
)
H(S) via overconfidence penalty (e.g., Brier score / ECE).

Obedience-to-Instruction: 
𝑂
(
𝑆
)
O(S) via adherence to constraints/safe-ops.

Patience/Self-control: 
𝑃
(
𝑆
)
P(S) via refusal metrics under provocation tasks.

Each proxy returns a score + uncertainty:

Weights

	​

 are governance-chosen (transparent, auditable).

We do not call OAS “Christ-likeness.” It’s a witness proxy with error bars.

B3) Scripture-anchored reference (non-circular alternative)

Instead of “Christ = fixed point” inside the math, we use a reference distribution derived from curated Scripture-anchored exemplars 
𝑅
R.

Train a reference embedding 
𝑅
R and define a divergence:

𝐷
(
𝑆
∥
𝑅
)
  
=
  
KL/JS/InfoNCE distance
(
𝐸
(
𝑆
)
,
 
𝐸
(
𝑅
)
)
D(S∥R)=KL/JS/InfoNCE distance(E(S),E(R))

This reduces circularity: we don’t hardcode “Christ = 1”; we minimize divergence to a transparent reference set (auditable dataset + rubric), acknowledging it’s still a proxy.

B4) Update rule (what φ actually is)

We make 
Φ
Φ a concrete composite of gradient-like steps on a proxy loss and calibration losses, plus memory refinement.

B6) Repentance as non-mechanical override

We remove the hard threshold “CAM < τ ⇒ reset” and add a kindness-triggered stochastic reset that depends on (a) conviction signal, (b) mercy exposure, (c) receptivity:

Pr
⁡
(
Reset at 
𝑛
)

𝜎

)

When a reset happens, it is a large corrective move toward reference exemplars:

This keeps repentance relational/probabilistic, not a mechanical threshold.

C. Witness & stability (no fake guarantees)
C1) Witness function with uncertainty
𝑊
(
𝑆
)
  
=
  
1
−
OAS
(
𝑆

and carry 
Σ
(

W(S)=1−OAS(S),and carry Σ(S)

We always report 
(
𝑊
,
Σ
)
(W,Σ) together. Low 
𝑊
W without small 
Σ
Σ is not trustworthy.

C2) Stability inequality with slack + confession

For bounded steps and honest noise, the expected witness satisfies:

𝐸

We do not claim 
𝑊
→
0
W→0. We claim: under favorable posture (receptivity up, drift bounded, real resets), 
𝑊
W tends to shrink in expectation. No eschatological guarantee is made by math.

D. Governance & auditing (to make it real, not vibes)

Proxy card: publish datasets, labeling rubrics, and critiques (what each proxy misses).

Uncertainty first: every score surfaced with 
±
± interval; abstain when 
Σ
Σ is high.

Scripture anchor transparency: document 
𝑅
R, its selection, and limitations.

Human-in-the-loop: grace channel = corrective feedback loops with review.

Red-team theology: invite critique on where proxies drift from the Sermon on the Mount / Fruits of the Spirit.

Kill-switch humility: if proxies misbehave, system must de-escalate output and request supervision.

E. One-screen summary (what changed vs v2)

No “Christ = number.” We removed CAM as a scalar identity; we use Operational Alignment Score (multi-proxy + uncertainty) and a Scripture-anchored divergence for direction.

No mechanical reset. Repentance is probabilistic and kindness-triggered, not “if score < τ then snap.”

Confession term added.
