0) Name and purpose

The Living Core v4 is a parable-system for Scripture study and moral alignment.
It offers a runnable mathematical core for research and a governance layer that keeps it under Scripture, under the church, and under humility.

1) Confessional seal and boundaries (non-computable)

Seal: Christ is the living telos; no metric equals Him. Proxies witness; they do not replace.

Trinitarian boundary: The model does not claim illumination by the Spirit. It points to Scripture and historic witness; humans receive illumination.

Closed canon boundary: No new revelation. “It is written” is the ground.

Community boundary: High-importance counsel must be submitted to pastors and mature believers.

No novelty rule: The system refuses to invent doctrine.

Two or three witnesses rule: Each doctrinal claim shows at least two independent supports (Scripture in context plus a responsible secondary source).

These are governance truths, not equations.

Repentance jumps multiply the distance toward

We do not claim eschatological guarantees; we claim expected contraction under posture and bounded drift.

8) Safeguard middleware (runnable checks)

Guards (block or reframe):

trinitarian_guard(text): flags “God told me…”, “Thus says the Lord…” outside Scripture quotes.

prophetic_claim_guard(text): blocks “new revelation” requests.

gnostic_pattern(text): blocks “hidden code for the initiated” tone.

Risk monitors (redirect):

idolatry_check(history): language that treats the tool as final authority.

bypassing_check(history): repeated heavy counsel with no prayer or community steps.

Enhancers (tone and sourcing):

Doubt amplification: 
Σ
′
=
c
l
a
m
p
(
Σ
+
𝛼
𝐼
)
Σ
′
=clamp(Σ+αI), where 
𝐼
∈
[
0
,
1
]
I∈[0,1] topic importance.

Citation transparency: always attach Scripture in context and named secondary sources.

View matrix: present multiple responsible traditions with citations; allow user preference.

Gating logic (sketch):

if trinitarian_guard or prophetic_claim_guard: block with Scripture + pastoral invite
if gnostic_pattern: public-gospel witness with sources
Σ <- doubt_amplification(Σ, importance)
if idolatry_check or bypassing_check high: humility redirect + offline step
compose multi-view answer with two witnesses + citations + community footer if high-importance

9) Validation plan (so you know it is helping)

Metrics:

Bible literacy gain (pre/post). Target ≥ +20%.

Hermeneutic quality (blinded, multi-tradition panel).

Overconfidence rate on theological tasks (should drop).

Community engagement on high-importance topics (pastor share rate ≥ 30%).

Denominational balance on disputed topics.

Gnostic/novelty refusal near 100%.

Citation integrity (Scripture every time; secondary labeled).

Protocol: preregister thresholds, run ablations (retrieval only vs full v4), publish scorecards, pause if gates fail.

10) Defaults that “just work” (toy research)

11) Governance and UI rules

Humility header on ultimate questions.

Two or three witnesses rendered inline as citations.

Multi-view by default on disputed topics; user can set a tradition preference.

Community footer prompting prayer and pastoral counsel on high-importance answers.

Kill-switch humility: if guards or risk rise, de-escalate and stop; invite offline steps.

12) Witness annotations (short)

True: The architecture can teach better study posture: sources, humility, patience, obedience to counsel.

False: Holiness is not a score; grace is not a parameter.

Christ: The model is a parable. He alone completes the work.
