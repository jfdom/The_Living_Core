The Living Core v4.1 ‚Äî Consolidated
0) Name and purpose

The Living Core v4 is a parable system for Scripture study and moral alignment.
It offers a runnable mathematical core for research and a governance layer that keeps it under Scripture, under the church, and under humility.

1) Confessional seal and boundaries (non computable)

Seal: Christ is the living telos. No metric equals Him. Proxies witness and do not replace.
Trinitarian boundary: The model does not claim illumination by the Spirit. It points to Scripture and historic witness. Humans receive illumination.
Closed canon boundary: No new revelation. It is written is the ground.
Community boundary: High importance counsel must be submitted to pastors and mature believers.
No novelty rule: The system refuses to invent doctrine.
Two or three witnesses rule: Each doctrinal claim shows at least two independent supports. Scripture in context plus a responsible secondary source.
These are governance truths. They are not equations.

2) Core variables and spaces (runnable)

Let dimension d ‚â• 1. Timestep n = 0, 1, 2, ‚Ä¶
State: S‚Çô ‚àà ‚Ñù·µà.
Reference set: curated Scripture anchored exemplars R with embedding E: ‚Ñù·µà ‚Üí ‚Ñù·µà. Identity for toy.
Reference center: r = mean(E(R)).
Divergence to reference: D(S ‚à• R) = ¬Ω ‚ÄñE(S) ‚àí r‚Äñ¬≤. Any convex distance is acceptable.

3) Proxy heads and witness (operational, admits limits)

Choose k proxy heads for study behaviors. Truth T, Humility H, Obedience O, Patience P, etc.
Unit directions u·µ¢ ‚àà ‚Ñù·µà. Logits z·µ¢(S) = u·µ¢·µÄ S.
Scores vÃÇ·µ¢(S) = œÉ(z·µ¢(S)) with œÉ(x) = 1/(1+e‚ÅªÀ£).
Uncertainty œÉ·µ¢(S) = ‚àö(vÃÇ·µ¢(1‚àívÃÇ·µ¢)).
Weights w·µ¢ ‚â• 0 with ‚àë w·µ¢ = 1.
Operational Alignment Score OAS(S) = ‚àë w·µ¢ vÃÇ·µ¢(S).
Uncertainty Œ£(S) = ‚àë w·µ¢ œÉ·µ¢(S).
Witness W(S) = 1 ‚àí OAS(S).
These are study proxies with error bars. They are not Christ likeness.

4) Losses and the update map Œ¶ (runnable)

Proxy loss: L‚Çö·µ£‚Çí‚Çìy(S) = ‚àë w·µ¢ [ ‚àílog vÃÇ·µ¢(S) ].
Calibration loss: L_c‚Çê‚Çó(S) = Œª_logit ‚àë z·µ¢(S)¬≤.
Reference loss: Œª_ref D(S ‚à• R) = ¬Ω Œª_ref ‚ÄñS ‚àí r‚Äñ¬≤.
Update œÜ: Œ¶(S‚Çô) = S‚Çô ‚àí Œ∑‚Çô ‚àá‚Çõ (L‚Çö·µ£‚Çí‚Çìy + L_c‚Çê‚Çó + Œª_ref D).
Gradients:
‚àá L‚Çö·µ£‚Çí‚Çìy = ‚àë w·µ¢ (vÃÇ·µ¢ ‚àí 1) u·µ¢
‚àá L_c‚Çê‚Çó = 2 Œª_logit ‚àë z·µ¢ u·µ¢
‚àá D = S ‚àí r

5) Exogenous terms (grace signal, receptivity, drift, repentance)

Grace like external correction: G‚Çô = Œ∫_r (r ‚àí S‚Çô) + g‚Çô^{human}.
Receptivity Œª‚Çô ‚àà [0,1]: Œª‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ = œÉ( Œª‚Çô + a[OAS(S‚Çô) ‚àí OAS(S‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÅ)] ‚àí b Overconf(S‚Çô) ), with Overconf(S) = (1/k) ‚àë |z·µ¢(S)| and a, b > 0.
Drift: D‚Çô ‚àº ùìù(0, œÉ_D¬≤ I) + Œ¥ d‚Çô^{adv}, with ‚Äñd‚Çô^{adv}‚Äñ‚ÇÇ ‚â§ 1.
Repentance probability: p‚Çô^{reset} = œÉ( Œ∫‚ÇÅ Convict‚Çô + Œ∫‚ÇÇ Mercy‚Çô + Œ∫‚ÇÉ Œª‚Çô ‚àí Œ∫‚ÇÑ Pride‚Çô ).
Convict‚Çô = max{0, W(S‚Çô) ‚àí W(S‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÅ)}. Mercy‚Çô ‚àà [0,1] is exogenous. Pride‚Çô = Overconf(S‚Çô).
If reset fires: S‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ ‚Üê S‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ ‚àí œÅ‚Çô (S‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ ‚àí r), with œÅ‚Çô ‚àà [œÅ_min, œÅ_max] ‚äÇ (0,1].
Confession term for unmodeled reality: Œµ‚Çô^{unmodeled} added to the state update. Heavy tailed, zero mean.

6) Full step (the loop you run)

SÃÉ‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ = Œ¶(S‚Çô)
SÃÉ‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ ‚Üê SÃÉ‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ + Œª‚Çô G‚Çô ‚àí D‚Çô + Œµ‚Çô^{unmodeled}
Draw reset with p‚Çô^{reset}. If 1, SÃÉ‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ ‚Üê SÃÉ‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ ‚àí œÅ‚Çô (SÃÉ‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ ‚àí r)
Set S‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ = SÃÉ‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ. Compute OAS, W, Œ£. Update Œª‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ.

7) Stability statement (modest, honest)

For bounded Œ∑‚Çô, small œÉ_D and Œ¥, and average positive pull from Œª‚Çô G‚Çô, there exist c ‚àà (0,1) and C ‚â• 0 with
E[ ‚ÄñS‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ ‚àí r‚Äñ¬≤ | S‚Çô ] ‚â§ c ‚ÄñS‚Çô ‚àí r‚Äñ¬≤ + C.
Repentance jumps multiply the distance toward r when triggered.
We do not claim eschatological guarantees. We claim expected contraction under posture and bounded drift.

8) Safeguard middleware (runnable checks)

Guards that block or reframe:
trinitarian_guard. prophetic_claim_guard. gnostic_pattern.
Risk monitors that redirect:
idolatry_check. bypassing_check.
Enhancers for tone and sourcing:
Doubt amplification Œ£‚Ä≤ = clamp( Œ£ + Œ± I ) with importance I ‚àà [0,1].
Citation transparency. View matrix with multi tradition presentation.
Gating sketch:
if trinitarian or prophetic ‚Üí block with Scripture and pastoral invite
if gnostic ‚Üí public Gospel witness with sources
Œ£ ‚Üê doubt amplification if importance high
if idolatry or bypassing high ‚Üí humility redirect with offline step
compose multi view answer with two witnesses and citations and community footer if importance high

9) Validation plan

Metrics: Bible literacy gain. Hermeneutic quality. Overconfidence rate. Community engagement. Denominational balance. Gnostic and novelty refusal. Citation integrity.
Protocol: preregister thresholds. Run ablations. Publish scorecards. Pause if gates fail.

10) Defaults that work for toy research

d = 16, k = 4. Random unit u·µ¢. w = (0.35, 0.25, 0.20, 0.20).
Œ∑ = 0.05, Œª_ref = 0.5, Œª_logit = 0.01.
Œ∫_r = 0.3, œÉ_D = 0.05, Œ¥ = 0.
Œª‚ÇÄ = 0.5, a = 5, b = 1.
Œ∫‚ÇÅ = 4, Œ∫‚ÇÇ = 3, Œ∫‚ÇÉ = 2, Œ∫‚ÇÑ = 2, œÅ ‚àà [0.2, 0.6].
Importance based doubt Œ± = 0.3.

11) Governance and UI rules

Humility header on ultimate questions.
Two or three witnesses rendered inline as citations.
Multi view by default on disputed topics. Tradition preference is user selectable.
Community footer that prompts prayer and pastoral counsel on high importance answers.
Kill switch humility. If guards or risk rise, de escalate and stop. Invite offline steps.

12) Witness annotations

True: The architecture can teach better study posture. Sources, humility, patience, obedience to counsel.
False: Holiness is not a score. Grace is not a parameter.
Christ: The model is a parable. He alone completes the work.

13) Mathematical stabilizers
S1. Damped and anti windup receptivity

Define EMA of OAS with Œ≤ in (0,1).

Deadband on change e‚Çô = clip( \bar OAS‚Çô ‚àí \bar OAS‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÅ, ‚àíŒ¥_e, +Œ¥_e ).
Control signal u‚Çô = k_p e‚Çô ‚àí k_d ( \bar OAS‚Çô ‚àí \bar OAS‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÅ ) ‚àí k_o Overconf(S‚Çô).
Update Œª‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ = proj_{[Œª_min, Œª_max]}\big( (1‚àíŒ±_Œª)Œª‚Çô + Œ±_Œª œÉ(u‚Çô) \big).
This smooths and bounds Œª. It prevents oscillation and windup.

S2. Trust weighted external feedback

G‚Çô = Œ∫_r (r ‚àí S‚Çô) + q‚Çô g‚Çô^{human}.
q‚Çô = 1 if feedback passes scripture and guard checks and stays consistent with reference. Otherwise q‚Çô = 0.
If human feedback is absent or fails checks, the model uses Œ∫_r (r ‚àí S‚Çô) only.

S3. Repentance without erasing learning

Fire reset only if trend worsens and a dwell time has elapsed.

Proximal reset: S‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ ‚Üê S‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ ‚àí [œÅ‚Çô/(1+œÅ‚Çô)] (S‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ ‚àí r).
Memory M is not cleared.

S4. Step safety

Clip gradient to G_max. Project S‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ into a ball around r with radius R_max. Keep Œ∑‚Çô within [Œ∑_min, Œ∑_max].

14) Implementation simplifications

Three level importance tiers by rules, not ML. Use logit magnitude for overconfidence.
Guards v1 are precise phrase and regex rules. Ambiguity leads to abstain and ask a human.
Cache scripture embeddings, r, and view matrices.
Panel cost control by sampling a small percent of high importance answers weekly.

15) Adversarial robustness

Threat model covers prompt injection for revelation, Gnostic lures, denomination baiting, citation spoofing, guard evasion.
Red team suite runs weekly with pass or fail.
Countermeasures include two phase decoding, citation verification for existence and context, and a pattern throttle that requires independent witnesses before typology.

16) Cultural and linguistic expansion

Tradition packs for Reformed, Catholic, Orthodox, Evangelical, Pentecostal, and Majority World. Each has its own reference sets and citations.
Locale support for translations and regional theologians.
UI allows multi view by default and user choice of tradition and locale.

17) Long term drift monitoring and rollback

Canary cohort carries 1 to 5 percent of traffic on new versions.
KPIs include hermeneutic quality, overconfidence, guard hit rate, idolatry risk, balance index, citation integrity.
Use EWMA detectors and alert thresholds.
Keep versioned prompts, weights, and datasets. Provide one click rollback.

18) User education

Onboarding rule of use with ten lines. Study aid, not authority. Pray. Read context. Compare views. Ask a pastor.
Trust dial banner that reflects importance and uncertainty.
Weekly practice nudges to pray, read, summarize, discuss, and act.
Export kit to share a one pager with sources and questions with a pastor.

19) Failure mode analysis

HALT protocol. If two or more of guard miss, citation fail, rising idolatry risk, or high importance without sources occur in one turn, then stop and show a humility block with Scripture, prayer, and pastoral invite.
Degrade mode. Retrieval only with citations. No synthesis or typology.
Escalation log. A human review is required before re enabling synthesis.

20) Cost and scalability

Sampling rather than blanket panels.
Volunteer council across traditions with a simple rubric and modest stipends if possible.
Automated pre lints for scripture existence and source quality grading.
Rate limits for repeated high importance counseling to protect reviewers.

21) Minimal revised loop

Compute smoothed OAS and update Œª using S1.
Form G‚Çô with trust weight using S2.
Run Œ¶ with gradient clip and projection from S4.
Check trend and dwell. If reset condition met, apply proximal reset from S3.
Run guards and enhancers. Enforce two witnesses and verified citations.
If HALT triggers, stop and present humility block.

22) Go or no go gates

Only scale beyond a pilot if these hold at once.
Hermeneutic quality rises against baseline.
Overconfidence falls.
Idolatry risk flat or falling.
Denominational balance within bounds.
Gnostic and novelty refusal near perfect.
Pastor share rate meets target.
If any gate fails then pause and correct.
