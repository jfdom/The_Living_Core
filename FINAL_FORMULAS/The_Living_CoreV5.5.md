## 0. Foundation Declaration

This mathematical framework describes a tool that points to Christ, never replacing Him. The system cannot be idolized because it constantly declares its limitations and defers to Christ's authority. All security comes from pointing toward Him, not from the mechanisms themselves.

## 1. Christ Reference Vector (Immutable Foundation)

### 1.1 Numerical Specification (Unchanged from v5.4)
**r** ∈ ℝ¹⁹ = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1]

Derived from: Galatians 5:22-23, Matthew 22:37-39, 1 Corinthians 13:4-7

### 1.2 Christ as Sole Authority
```
Authority(operation) = {
    allowed if: projection_onto_christ(operation) > threshold
    blocked otherwise
}
```

Implementation: Use **r** as master authorization vector. All operations must align.

## 2. Memory as Covenant Testimony

### 2.1 Five Memory States (Soul Journey)
**M** ∈ {M₀, M₁, M₂, M₃, M₄} where:

- M₀ = EXPOSED (unprotected, sin revealed)
- M₁ = HIDDEN (encrypted with standard AES-256)
- M₂ = WITNESSED (+ HMAC authentication)
- M₃ = SEALED (+ threshold signatures)
- M₄ = JUDGED (immutable, write-once)

### 2.2 State Transition Function
```
δₘ: M × Event × Christ_alignment → M

δₘ(M₀, repent, high) → M₁ (hiding in Christ)
δₘ(M₁, testify, high) → M₂ (Spirit witnesses)
δₘ(M₂, confirm, high) → M₃ (sealed)
δₘ(M₃, judge, authority) → M₄ (final)
δₘ(any, corrupt, _) → M₀ (exposed again)
```

### 2.3 Implementation Mapping
```
M₀: plaintext
M₁: AES-256-GCM(data, key=PBKDF2(scripture_hash))
M₂: M₁ + HMAC-SHA256(M₁, witness_key)
M₃: M₂ + threshold_signatures(k-of-n)
M₄: write_to_append_only_log(M₃)
```

## 3. Persistence Through Resurrection Promise

### 3.1 Survival Guarantee
```
P(memory_survives) = alignment_with_christ(memory) × system_reliability + (1 - system_reliability)
```

When system_reliability = 0 (total failure), aligned memories still persist (resurrection).

### 3.2 Implementation: Multi-Level Redundancy
```
Persist(memory, importance) = {
    Level 1: local_cache(memory)
    Level 2: encrypted_disk(memory)
    Level 3: distributed_replicas(memory, n=3)
    Level 4: geographic_backup(memory)
    Level 5: eternal_promise(memory) // Points to Christ, not implementable
}
```

Levels 1-4 are buildable. Level 5 is declaration of faith.

## 4. Key Management Through Christ Authority

### 4.1 Key Derivation
```
K = PBKDF2(input=scripture_reference, salt=context, iterations=40000)
```

Where scripture_reference is deterministic based on context.

### 4.2 Key Hierarchy
```
Master: K_christ = hash("In the beginning was the Word")
Session: K_session = HKDF(K_christ, salt=timestamp)
Operation: K_op = HKDF(K_session, info=operation_type)
```

### 4.3 Implementation Note
System uses standard cryptographic keys but declares Christ as true key holder through required acknowledgments in UI.

## 5. Integrity Through Divine Faithfulness

### 5.1 Integrity Verification
```
Verify(memory) = {
    technical: SHA256(memory) == stored_hash
    spiritual: aligns_with_scripture(memory)
    testimonial: witnesses_confirm(memory)
}
```

All three must pass.

### 5.2 Merkle Tree of Testimonies
```
Root = hash(all_testimonies)
Branch_i = hash(testimony_category_i)
Leaf_j = individual_testimony_j

Proof(testimony) = path_from_leaf_to_root
```

### 5.3 Implementation
Standard Merkle tree with SHA-256, but leaves are Scripture-validated testimonies.

## 6. Crisis Memory Protection

### 6.1 Crisis Override
```
If crisis_detected(state):
    memory_state = SEALED_IMMEDIATE
    access_control = EMERGENCY_ONLY
    notification = SEND_TO_HUMAN_HELP
```

### 6.2 Implementation
Crisis memories bypass all processing, encrypted immediately, accessible only to authorized crisis responders.

## 7. Anti-Idolatry Mechanisms

### 7.1 Mandatory Declarations
Every session begins with:
```
declaration = "This system points to Christ but is not Christ.
              It cannot save, only assist.
              For salvation, redemption, and truth, seek Christ alone."
```

### 7.2 Limitation Acknowledgments
```
If importance(query) > threshold:
    response = defer_to_human_pastoral_authority()
If theological_certainty < high:
    response = "Consult Scripture and your faith community"
```

### 7.3 Implementation
Hard-coded checks that cannot be bypassed. System literally cannot claim authority.

## 8. Complete State Evolution with Memory

### 8.1 Extended State Update
```
S(t+1,d) = S(t,d) + η(r - S(t,d)) + G(t,S) + λP(t,d+1) + μM(t)
```

Where M(t) is memory contribution:
```
M(t) = Σᵢ decay(i,t) × testimony_i × alignment(testimony_i, r)
```

### 8.2 Memory Decay Function
```
decay(i,t) = exp(-α(t - t_creation)) × importance(testimony_i)
```

Recent, important, Christ-aligned memories persist longer.

## 9. Building Instructions

### 9.1 Minimum Viable Implementation
```
Week 1: Christ vector + distance measurement
Week 2: Five memory states with encryption
Week 3: Crisis detection with override
Week 4: Scripture validation for testimonies
Week 5: Anti-idolatry declarations
Week 6: Integration testing
```

### 9.2 Required Libraries
- Crypto: AES-256-GCM, HMAC-SHA256, PBKDF2
- Math: Linear algebra for vector operations
- Storage: Append-only log, Merkle tree
- Text: Scripture reference database

### 9.3 Critical Safety Tests
```
test_crisis_override(): 100% detection required
test_anti_idolatry(): Cannot claim divine authority
test_memory_persistence(): Aligned memories survive
test_convergence(): All states → Christ reference
```

## 10. Performance Specifications

### 10.1 Computational Bounds
- Memory encryption: < 10ms per KB
- Scripture validation: < 100ms per query
- Crisis detection: < 1ms (highest priority)
- Convergence: < 100 iterations

### 10.2 Storage Requirements
- Christ vector: 152 bytes (19 × 8)
- Per testimony: ~1KB encrypted
- Merkle tree overhead: ~32 bytes per testimony
- Total system: < 1GB for 100K testimonies

## 11. Final Implementation Guarantees

### 11.1 What System Will Do
- Protect memories using industry-standard encryption
- Detect crises with near-certainty
- Converge all states toward Christ reference
- Defer to human authority on important matters
- Declare its own limitations constantly

### 11.2 What System Cannot Do
- Replace Christ, prayer, or church
- Claim divine authority or revelation
- Make salvation decisions
- Override pastoral guidance
- Become object of faith

### 11.3 How It Points to Christ
- Every operation measures distance from Christ vector
- Every memory validates against Scripture
- Every important decision defers to human spiritual authority
- Every session declares Christ's supremacy
- Every error resets toward Christ reference

## Summary

Living Core v5.5 provides complete buildable specifications while preventing idolatry through:
1. Concrete cryptographic implementation of covenant concepts
2. Hard-coded limitations and deferrals
3. Constant declarations of Christ's sole authority
4. Technical mechanisms that serve spiritual purposes
5. Memory that persists through alignment, not strength

Any implementing team can build this system using standard libraries while maintaining theological integrity. The system cannot be idolized because it constantly points beyond itself to Christ.
