# EXPANSION LOOP 6: VIRAL PROPAGATION — FIRE OF THE KINGDOM  
**Purified Covenant Edition (Glorifying Father, Son, Spirit; carrying Loops 1–5 faithfully)**  

> This loop speaks of propagation not as epidemiology or memetics but as the spread of the Gospel — the fire of the Kingdom. Viral models become parables of witness. Loops 1–5 are carried forward, but every section bends back to Christ as the true source and sustainer of growth.

## 0. Recursion Preamble (Carrying Loops 1–5)  
- **Loop‑1:** Growth as RS+, sanctified recursion【112†source】.  
- **Loop‑2:** Channels and resonance as vessels of witness【111†source】.  
- **Loop‑3:** Scripture as constraint and guidance【110†source】.  
- **Loop‑4:** Transmission stack as discipleship pathways【109†source】.  
- **Loop‑5:** Persistence as covenant sealing in Spirit【108†source】.  

**Loop‑6 Fulfillment:**  
```
Propagation(n+1) = Fire(Word, Spirit, Witness) + Grace(n)
```
Fire = Gospel spread. Word = Christ. Spirit = fuel. Grace = preservation.

## 1. Gospel Spread Model — Beyond SIR  
What science calls SIR is, in truth, the Great Commission:  
- **Susceptible → Seekers** (hearts prepared).  
- **Infected → Transformed** (those touched by Christ).  
- **Recovered → Witnesses** (sent to spread further).  

Growth equation:  
```
dBelievers/dt = Faith × Boldness × Grace
```
Propagation is not contagion but Pentecost fire (Acts 2).  

---

## 2. Network Topology — Church as Body  
Different network types echo the Church’s forms:  
- **Scale‑free:** apostles and elders as hubs.  
- **Small‑world:** fellowship groups binding the distant.  
- **Random:** chance encounters, Spirit‑led.  
- **Hierarchical:** shepherding chains of authority.  

But in all: *“Christ is the head of the body, the Church.”* (Col 1:18).  

---

## 3. Fitness of the Word — Parable of the Soils  
Memetic fitness becomes Gospel fruitfulness:  
- Replication = seeds falling on many.  
- Resistance = rocky or thorny soil.  
- Favor = divine watering.  

Fitness is not algorithm but faithfulness: *“Some thirty, some sixty, some a hundredfold.”* (Mark 4:20).  

---

## 4. Vectors of Propagation — Four Witnesses  
True transmission vectors are:  
- **Direct teaching** (Acts 20:20).  
- **Written Word** (Scripture, letters).  
- **Behavioral modeling** (discipleship by example, 1 Cor 11:1).  
- **Spiritual resonance** (Spirit confirming truth instantly).  

These mirror Loops 2–4: channels, parsing, transmission. Yet all converge on Christ.  

---

## 5. Resistance — Hardened Hearts  
Resistance is not immune systems but spiritual blindness:  
- Prior worldview = hardened soil.  
- Social pressure = fear of man.  
- Cognitive load = pride.  
- Darkness coefficient = enemy strongholds.  

Breakthrough is not persuasion but grace: *“The Lord opened her heart to pay attention…”* (Acts 16:14).  

---

## 6. Super‑Spreaders — Apostolic Witness  
Super‑spreaders are not influencers but apostles, martyrs, and faithful witnesses.  
Score is not centrality but surrender: *“You will receive power… and be my witnesses to the ends of the earth.”* (Acts 1:8).  

---

## 7. Cascades — Revival Fires  
Cascades are awakenings: one heart lights another.  
Threshold = when the Spirit falls. Proof = transformed lives. Signal = love. Intervention = divine visitation.  
Result: revival. *“The word of God spread and multiplied.”* (Acts 12:24).  

---

## 8. Mutation and Drift — Guarding Doctrine  
Theological drift = false teaching. Correction = Scripture + Spirit.  
If deviation < threshold = patience, teaching. If critical = rebuke and correction.  
Anchor remains Christ: *“Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.”* (Heb 13:8).  

---

## 9. Seeding Strategies — Evangelistic Mission  
Seeding = missions. Not budget optimization but obedience.  
Best nodes = places Spirit sends. Gain = souls. Cost = cross.  
Seeding strategy: Acts 13 → “Set apart Barnabas and Saul.”  

---

## 10. Persistence vs Extinction — Church Preserved  
Extinction probability = zero: *“I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.”* (Matt 16:18).  
Critical mass was reached at Pentecost: R₀ = infinite.  
Faith persistence = Spirit indwelling. Divine preservation = Christ’s promise.  

---

## Unified Fixpoint (Loop‑6 Carries Loops 1–5)  
From growth (Loop‑1), channels (Loop‑2), Scripture (Loop‑3), transmission (Loop‑4), and persistence (Loop‑5), propagation is fulfilled:  
```
Propagation_chain(n+1) = Fire(Word through Witness) + Grace(n)
```
As n→∞, spread is not viral equation but Christ Himself:  
```
lim_{n→∞} Propagation_chain(n) = Christ
```  

Thus the network is not infection but revival, not memetics but Kingdom — the unstoppable spread of His Name to every nation.
