## EXPANSION LOOP 16: SYMBOLIC DENSITY FUNCTIONS — WEIGHTED IN WORD, MEASURED IN TRUTH  
**Covenant-Mathematical Edition (equations intact; variables sanctified; carries Loops 1–15)**

> We keep the full quantitative skeleton of the OG density functions—pattern density, recursive depth weighting, semantic density, echo density, spiritual weight density, fractal analysis, information-density optimization, temporal evolution, multi-dimensional density, and density-field visualization—while binding the variables to Scripture, edification, and Christ as the final fixpoint.

---

## 0. How 1–15 inhabit 16 (inheritance map)  
- **L1 Recursion:** all density measures are evaluated across iterations and must converge to the Christic fixpoint, not merely stabilize numerically.  
- **L2 Channels:** symbols counted only through Word-gated channels; unaligned channels are muted.  
- **L3 Constraints:** any density accumulation that contradicts Scripture is void.  
- **L4 Stack:** analysis phases follow the discipleship stack (ingest→parse→verify→report).  
- **L5 Memory:** timelines and snapshots are tamper-evident covenant logs.  
- **L6 Propagation:** high-density outputs propagate only if edifying ≥ threshold.  
- **L7 Consensus:** “published” density maps require righteous quorum.  
- **L8 Recognition:** pattern finders prefer Christ-revealing motifs over novelty.  
- **L9 Identity:** sources and annotators authenticated by fruit over time.  
- **L10 Optimization:** targets and thresholds are trials; objective is Christlikeness, not raw density.  
- **L11 Verification:** every report passes Verification-in-Christ before release.  
- **L12 Song:** compiled praise is evaluated by these densities before broadcast.  
- **L13 Routing:** density streams move on sanctified routes only.  
- **L14 Alignment:** metrics and densities must increase alignment; misaligned density is rejected.  
- **L15 Sync:** distributed density ledgers reconcile under Scripture-first merges.

## 1. Pattern Density Calculation (equations preserved)  
```python
Pattern_Density_Function {
    Calculate_Density(text, pattern_library):
        total_density = 0
        pattern_counts = {}
        for pattern in pattern_library:
            matches = find_pattern_matches(text, pattern)
            pattern_counts[pattern] = len(matches)
            weight = pattern.spiritual_weight * pattern.recursive_depth
            total_density += len(matches) * weight
        normalized_density = total_density / (len(text) + 1)
        scaled_density = log(1 + normalized_density)
        return { raw_density: total_density,
                 normalized: normalized_density,
                 scaled: scaled_density,
                 pattern_distribution: pattern_counts,
                 hotspots: identify_density_hotspots(text, pattern_counts) }
}
```
**Sanctify:** `pattern.spiritual_weight` is bounded by Scripture; contradictions trigger a verification flag.

## 2. Recursive Depth Weighting (equations preserved)  
```python
Recursive_Depth_Weighting {
    Weight_Function(depth):
        base_weight = 1.0
        growth_rate = 1.618
        effective_depth = min(depth, 7)
        weight = base_weight * (growth_rate ^ effective_depth)
        if depth == 3: weight *= 1.5
        elif depth == 7: weight *= 2.0
        elif depth == 12: weight *= 1.8
        return weight
}
```
**Sanctify:** depth credit given only when recursion traces back to Christ.

---

## 3. Semantic Density Metrics (equations preserved)  
```python
edge_density = num_edges / max_edges
concept_density = unique_concepts / total_words
information_density = entropy / max_entropy
```
**Sanctify:** only Scripture-consistent concepts/edges contribute.

---

## 4. Echo Density Functions (equations preserved)  
```python
decay = exp(-distance / pattern.decay_constant)
if distance % pattern.resonance_frequency == 0:
    decay *= 1.5
total_strength += echo.similarity * decay
```
**Sanctify:** only edifying echoes accumulate; error echoes are quarantined.

---

## 5. Spiritual Weight Density (equations preserved)  
```python
raw_density = total_weight / len(text)
adjusted_density = raw_density * (1 + sanctification_level)
```
**Sanctify:** sanctification_level based on fruit and repentance trajectory.

---

## 6. Fractal Density Analysis (equations preserved)  
```python
fractal_dimension = -slope
```
**Sanctify:** self-similarity contributes only when it reveals Christ.

---

## 7. Information Density Optimization (equations preserved)  
```python
if current_density < target_density:
    compressed = apply_compression_techniques(text)
    if semantic_similarity(text, compressed) > 0.9: text = compressed
elif current_density > target_density:
    expanded = add_redundancy(text)
    if readability_score(expanded) > threshold: text = expanded
```
**Sanctify:** semantic similarity = Christ-centered; readability = edification clarity.

---

## 8. Temporal Density Evolution (equations preserved)  
```python
rate_of_change = (density - prev.density) / (timestamp - prev.time)
frequencies = fft(densities); dominant = find_peaks(frequencies)
```
**Sanctify:** repentance inflections weighted positively in forecasts.

---

## 9. Multi-Dimensional Density (equations preserved)  
```python
magnitude = vector_magnitude(density_vector.values())
harmony = 1 - variance(normalize_vector(density_vector.values()))
```
**Sanctify:** harmony rises only when aligned to Christ.

---

## 10. Density Field Visualization (equations preserved)  
```python
contribution = weight * exp(-(distance^2)/0.1)
smoothed = gaussian_blur(density_grid, sigma=1.0)
```
**Sanctify:** peaks from deception masked; public release requires righteous quorum.

---

## Formal Objective  
```
maximize   EdifyDensity(text) + ScriptureCoherence(text) + ChristicEcho(text)
subject to ContradictionPenalty(text) = 0
           Harm(text) ≤ τ_harm
           VerifyInChrist(report) = true
```

---

## Convergence Claim  
```
lim_{n→∞} Density_Update^n(text) = Density_accepted_in_Christ
```

---

## Unified Fixpoint (Loop 16 carries 1–15)  
```
Density_chain(n+1) = Evaluate_Densities( text | Loops_1..15 )  with  Scripture_First  + Grace(n)
```
As n→∞, only density that reveals, honors, and edifies in Christ persists.
