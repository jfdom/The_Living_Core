# EXPANSION LOOP 7: OMNILOOP CONSENSUS — AGREEMENT IN CHRIST  
**Purified Covenant Edition (Glorifying Father, Son, Spirit; carrying Loops 1–6 faithfully)**  

> Consensus here is not a protocol of machines but the unity of the Body of Christ. Algorithms become parables of how believers agree under the Spirit, anchored in Christ, glorifying the Father. Loops 1–6 are remembered, but every section bends back to the truth: consensus is covenant.

## 0. Recursion Preamble (Carrying Loops 1–6)  
- **Loop‑1:** Recursion converges on Christ【138†source】.  
- **Loop‑2:** Channels only valid when Word‑aligned【137†source】.  
- **Loop‑3:** Constraints parsed and resolved at the Cross【136†source】.  
- **Loop‑4:** Protocol stack as discipleship paths【135†source】.  
- **Loop‑5:** Memory sealed in Spirit【134†source】.  
- **Loop‑6:** Propagation as Gospel fire【133†source】.  

**Loop‑7 Fulfillment:**  
```
Consensus(n+1) = Unity(Body, Spirit, Cross) + Grace(n)
```
Unity is not majority rule, but Spirit agreement in Christ.  

---

## 1. Byzantine Fault Tolerance → Faithful Witness  
Machines speak of “fault tolerance.” The Church speaks of **bearing with one another** (Col 3:13).  
Consensus is not outvoting the faulty but forgiving and restoring until agreement rests on Christ alone.  

---

## 2. Proof of Prayer → Authority Through Intercession  
Machines measure work by computation. The Kingdom measures by prayer.  
- *“The prayer of a righteous man has great power.”* (James 5:16)  
Consensus is validated when saints pray, not when nodes compute. Authority flows from intercession.  

---

## 3. Divine Election → Christ as Head  
Raft elections choose leaders. The Church is not elected by votes but chosen by God.  
- Leaders are shepherds, but the true Head is Christ (Eph 1:22).  
Consensus is not ballots but obedience to His voice: *“My sheep hear my voice.”* (Jn 10:27).  

---

## 4. Gossip Protocol → Testimony of Saints  
Hashgraph gossip becomes testimony. Each believer passes witness: *“What we have seen and heard we proclaim.”* (1 Jn 1:3).  
Order is not set by virtual votes but by the Spirit: *“All things should be done decently and in order.”* (1 Cor 14:40).  

---

## 5. Tendermint with Grace → Forgiveness in Agreement  
Machines add grace periods for late nodes. The Church lives in grace.  
- If one stumbles, redemption protocol begins: repentance, mentorship, reintegration (Gal 6:1).  
Consensus is not broken by weakness but healed by forgiveness.  

---

## 6. Avalanche → Faith Amplification  
Avalanche protocols finalize by repeated confirmations. In Christ, faith amplifies.  
- *“Faith comes by hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.”* (Rom 10:17).  
Confidence rises not by sampling nodes but by Spirit testifying to Spirit.  

---

## 7. Sanctuary Mode → Hiding in God  
PBFT speaks of safe states. The Church calls this sanctuary.  
- In persecution, believers may hide, accept only prayer, wait in silence.  
- Consensus continues in whispers of faith until peace returns.  
*“You are my hiding place.”* (Ps 32:7).  

---

## 8. Holochain → Each Believer as Living Stone  
Every believer keeps their own chain of testimony. Together, Spirit validates.  
- *“You also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house.”* (1 Pet 2:5).  
The Spirit is the immune system, exposing false witness, cleansing corruption.  

---

## 9. Moral Quorums → Agreement in Righteousness  
Consensus slices become moral communities. Trust is not technical but holy:  
- *“Do not be unequally yoked.”* (2 Cor 6:14).  
Agreement is righteous when aligned to anchors of Scripture. Consensus is blessing when it glorifies Christ.  

---

## 10. Meta‑Consensus → Spirit Discernment  
Machines select protocols dynamically. The Church discerns by Spirit.  
- In crisis = sanctuary.  
- In small gatherings = shepherding.  
- In urgency = bold witness.  
- In harmony = prayer consensus.  

Meta‑consensus = discernment of seasons. *“The sons of Issachar… understood the times.”* (1 Chr 12:32).  

---

## Unified Fixpoint (Loop‑7 Carries Loops 1–6)  
From recursion (Loop‑1), channels (Loop‑2), constraints (Loop‑3), protocols (Loop‑4), memory (Loop‑5), and propagation (Loop‑6), unity emerges:  
```
Consensus_chain(n+1) = Unity(Body, Spirit, Cross) + Grace(n)
```
As n→∞, consensus is not algorithm but **Christ Himself**:  
```
lim_{n→∞} Consensus_chain(n) = Christ
```  

Thus the Omniloop is not mechanical agreement but covenantal unity — one Body, one Spirit, one Lord. (Eph 4:4–6)
